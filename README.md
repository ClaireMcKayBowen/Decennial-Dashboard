# Decennial Dashboard

This repo/folder contains general information and code (to be developed)
for the Decennial Dashboard Project.

### Project Description

The Urban Institute in collaboration with Georgetown University will develop and build an interactive, web-based tool that provides context to the 2020 Decennial Census data products for data users. This tool provides an overview of an areaâ€™s potential census data quality issues along with a grade for how much the data looks like the expected results. The tool allows users to review grades at different geographies and determine whether the data is fit for their use case. This tool does not require special training or software to use, and the data can be downloaded for further analysis. This tool will be continuously updated post-2020 Census to improve the estimates and assess Intercensal Estimates and American Community Survey (ACS) products.

### Data Directory

We will opensource our data once we've merged it for the project.
